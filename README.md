# mdm/product

SKUs, categories, unit-of-measure conversions, batch and serial tracking policies, and standard costs.

## Use it in a project

```bash
brickkit add mdm/product@2.0.0
brickkit up
```

Prepare first: see "Before you deploy" in BRICKKIT.md (a PostgreSQL schema and login role, NATS, the authorization and JWKS URLs, and the permission key `mdm.product.set_status` for whoever enables and disables products).

## Development

Go 1.25, Gin, `database/sql` with pgx, golang-migrate through be-sdk-go. Tests need a real PostgreSQL (`TEST_PG_DSN`); the commands and what success looks like are in AGENTS.md, section "Build and test". Inside the BrickEnterprise project, `make verify ID=mdm/product FOCUS=1` at the project root runs it for real, in a container and as a local process, and tears down afterwards.
